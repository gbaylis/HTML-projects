I got my start into programming, when I wanted to learn how to make websites. 
This project was meant to be a recipe website.
This project is not complete, the font size is not consistent, but I wanted to expriment with linking pages
and changing the colors of fonts. I am more interested in Python programming, however, for anyone starting out in
programming, learning the basics of website design can be interesting. I had fun learning how to make each ingredient 
in the recipe list, a different shade of red or blue.
